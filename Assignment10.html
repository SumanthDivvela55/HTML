            <p>The `DOCTYPE` declaration is the first line of an HTML document and specifies the document type.</p>
            <p>The `<html>` element is the root element of the HTML document and contains all other elements.</p>
            <p>The `lang` attribute within the `<html>` element specifies the document's language for better accessibility and search engine optimization.</p>
            <p>The `<meta charset="UTF-8">` element ensures proper character display by specifying the character encoding as UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters.</p>
            <p>The `<title>` element defines the title of the webpage, appearing in the browser tab.</p>
            <h1>Special Characters</h1>
            <p>The ampersand symbol (`&amp;`) is used for various purposes in HTML, including representing special characters.</p>
            <p>The less than symbol (`&lt;`) and greater than symbol (`&gt;`) have special meanings in HTML, so we use entities to display them literally.</p>
